# About  SDNRand.py
In practice, to emulate real network scenarios for SDN applications, it is necessary to generate packets from different sources and destinations in random interval, protocol , packet size etc.

## Installation
```bash
sudo apt-get install hping3
git clone https://github.com/tasnimul92/SDN.git
cd SDN
python SDNRand.py protocol_name(i.e. udp/icmp/tcp-timestamp) destination(i.e. 10.0.0.3)

```
# About Qlearningconvergence.py
This is code is part of my Research Project. PDF file of that will be uploaded soon. Emulation of Software-Defined Network was done in ONOS.
